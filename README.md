# TechOnTap

 ‘Tech On Tap’ is an app for exploring different types of careers in Tech. This will help to provide the User with a snapshot-view of the leading jobs in the field. After registering, the User can review the top 3 Tech jobs in the US right now which will include  job description, salary, experience/education needed for the job.  The Web App will feature 3 compatibility quizzes. The questions will consist of the skills, workplace setting, and common tasks specific to that position. The higher the score, the better fitted one is for the position.  One of three potential messages will be shown from the results category(based on how high the User scored) for the compatibility response. The User will then be able to restart the quiz with a button. Information about other career options will be available in the Web App. The ‘Career Goals’ section will allow the User to create goals for themselves and mark them as Completed as well as the option to Delete them.
	 This app has the potential to bridge a gap between skill set and success for a future in tech. After deciding to pursue a career in the Tech field, and unfamiliar with what my options were, I searched with Google and there was great information-but it was scattered across hundreds of mouse clicks! I remember searching for hours, trying and failing to find an all-in-one resource for the top jobs, in order to find that great-fit position in Tech.
